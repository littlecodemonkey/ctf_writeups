**Capture the Flag writeups**

I have been in development for several years, but have recently moved to the security field. As such, I thought it would be an interesting way to supplement my learning process by performing capture the flag competitions.

This repository is my journey through various Capture the Flag competitions. I'm not really sure how useful this will be for anyone else, but it will be a nice way for me to keep notes, and remind myself of what I have learned through this process.
